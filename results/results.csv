1,1,"The backstory about the protagonist's first double role, where he altered the route to shield sacred Indian sites, is not directly contradicted by the evidence from the novel. In fact, the novel mentions the protagonist's interactions with Indians and his knowledge of their culture, which suggests that he may have had experiences similar to those described in the backstory. However, the connection between the backstory and the novel is not explicitly stated, which reduces the confidence in the judgment."
2,1,"The backstory about the protagonist's deference to Lady Glenarvan echoing his tangled feelings for his mother is not directly contradicted by the evidence. In fact, the novel portrays Lord Glenarvan's affection and respect for his wife, Lady Helena, which is consistent with the idea that he has a deep-seated need to protect and care for the women in his life. The evidence also highlights the strong relationships and bonds between the characters, which supports the plausibility of the backstory."
