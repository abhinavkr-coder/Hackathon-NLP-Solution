59,1,"The backstory claims that the character posed as a relay-station hand, slipped captivity, returned to the mountains, and stayed alive with rope-climbing and avalanche-reading skills. Key evidence pieces supporting this claim include the successful descent of the mountain using a rope (Evidence 1), the use of rope-climbing skills to navigate the mountain (Evidence 2), and the character's ability to read avalanches (implied by their ability to navigate the mountain safely). The semantic analysis results show a moderate support score of 0.45, but no explicit contradictions were found. The causal consistency score is high at 0.70, indicating that the evidence pieces are well-connected and consistent with the claims. Given the moderate support score and high causal consistency, I predict a consistent alignment between the backstory and the evidence."
60,0,"The backstory claims that Thalcave led a night dig that saved eight survivors, including French geographer Roux, from an avalanche in 1852. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. In fact, the novel does not mention Thalcave's past rescue experience or his involvement in a silver-prospecting caravan. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.71, indicating a moderate alignment between the backstory and the novel. However, the lack of explicit evidence supporting the claim and the presence of contradictions in the novel's portrayal of Thalcave's character and abilities lead to a judgment of inconsistency. The causal consistency score of 0.70 further supports this conclusion."
124,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: ""On the Marseille quay he noticed young Caderousse stealing a mooring rope but said nothing."" This claim is an event that occurred in the past, and its importance is low."
111,1,"The claims ""pulled strings through old friends"" and ""quietly encouraging several anti-royalist moves"" are supported by Evidence 1, which shows Andrea's influence and connections. However, the overall support score is 0.47, indicating weak alignment. The causal consistency score is 0.70, which adds some confidence to the judgment. Therefore, we predict a judgment of 1 with a confidence of 0.65-0.75."
135,0,"The claims found in the backstory are not strongly supported by the evidence from the novel. The semantic analysis shows a weak alignment (0.52 support score) and moderate causal consistency (0.70). The evidence does not provide clear connections to the claims, and there are no explicit contradictions. Therefore, the final confidence is 0.75, indicating an INCONCLUSIVE judgment."
27,0,"The backstory claims that the character ran away to the docks at twelve, worked as a porter, and lost hearing in his left ear after a beating for secretly poring over a captain's charts. However, upon analyzing the provided evidence from the novel, we find no direct alignment with these claims. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.45, indicating a weak alignment. Moreover, there are no explicit contradictions detected, but the causal consistency score is 0.70, which is below the threshold for strong alignment. Given the weak evidence and lack of direct alignment, we default to inconsistent, predicting a score of 0 with 0.85 confidence."
110,0,"The claims about the locked study full of revolutionary pamphlets and private letters, and rereading them alone while weighing his past, are not supported by the provided text. The overall support score is low (0.42), indicating a lack of alignment between the claims and the evidence. Despite the high causal consistency score, the lack of direct evidence leads to a prediction of inconsistency."
42,0,"The backstory claims that the character accepted a lucrative berth on the British merchant Britannia, with first mate Fletcher valuing his experience but warning others about his ""unstable record."""
56,1,"The character predicted an earthquake and saved the entire party, which is supported by multiple evidence pieces (Evidence 1, 3, 4, and 5). However, the character's decline of payment is contradicted by multiple evidence pieces (Evidence 1 and 2). The overall support score is 0.41, and the causal consistency score is 0.70. Given the weak alignment and the presence of contradictions, the final confidence is 0.85-0.90."
80,0,"The provided backstory claims that the protagonist began learning tactics, spear-craft, and jungle tracking from his father at the age of ten and became a ""Junior Champion"" by pinning a sounder of wild boar with one spear at the age of twelve. However, the same year, pirate raiders killed his father, and the paramount chief made the boy a ""Junior Warrior"" charged with patrolling the island."
28,0,"The backstory claims that Ayrton was forced to give false testimony and taste ""legalised plunder"" after the captain pocketed the cargo-insurance money and framed the mate. Key evidence pieces that contradict this claim include Glenarvan's conversation with Ayrton, where Ayrton agrees to guide Glenarvan to the eastern coast and join the Duncan at Melbourne (Evidence 1), and Ayrton's subsequent offer to go to Melbourne and bring the Duncan to Twofold Bay (Evidence 2). The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.80, indicating moderate alignment, but no explicit contradictions were found. However, the causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the evidence does not strongly support the backstory claim. Therefore, the final confidence is 0.85, indicating that the backstory claim is inconsistent with the evidence."
101,0,"The backstory claims that the character joined a radical republican cell at eighteen, speaking in cafés and back-room meetings for the revolutionary cause. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the character, Edmond Dantès, was imprisoned and later became the Count of Monte Cristo, seeking revenge against those who wronged him. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.31, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the evidence. Furthermore, the causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the evidence does not provide a clear causal link to the backstory claim. The absence of any explicit contradictions and the low support score lead to a conclusion that the backstory is inconsistent with the evidence from the novel."
91,0,"The backstory claims that Villefort worked directly for Fouché, organizing the assassination of royalist deputies while posing as a Ministry of Justice official. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim."
24,0,"The backstory claims that the character proposed a South-American trade route to the naval board, was transferred to London, and recommended for a berth on Captain Grant's new ship Brittany. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support these claims."
119,0,"The claims found in the backstory do not have direct evidence in the provided text. The overall support score is 0.60, indicating moderate alignment. The causal consistency score is 0.70, which is above the threshold. However, since there is no direct evidence to support the claims, the confidence is lower than the maximum."
93,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: ""He secretly raised the 'Southern Army' in Marseille for Napoleon"" and ""left traceable evidence—copies of the ciphered letters hidden inside oak barrels in his own vineyard, later unearthed by Villefort."" Key evidence alignment/contradiction is found in Evidence 4, where Villefort is informed about the arrest of Edmond Dantès, and the conversation between Villefort and Morrel reveals Villefort's royalist background and his suspicion of Morrel's Bonapartist leanings. The semantic analysis shows a strong support score of 0.73 and a causal consistency score of 0.70, indicating a consistent alignment between the backstory and the novel's evidence. The final confidence justification is based on the strong support score and the absence of explicit contradictions, leading to a high confidence of 0.92."
72,0,"The backstory claims that Glenarvan trained twelve English-speaking youths as spies, sent them into Auckland; two became servants who secretly watched Glenarvan. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. The novel mentions Thalcave, a Patagonian guide, who is the one who helps Glenarvan and his companions. There is no mention of Glenarvan training spies or sending them to Auckland."

30,0,"The backstory claims that the character joined the Indian-Ocean pirate crew Black Tide and became second mate within three years, earning the pirate nickname ""Blood Raven."" However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. The novel mentions Captain Mangles, who is the captain of the Duncan, and his crew's struggles to navigate the Macquarie and avoid pirates. There is no mention of a pirate crew called Black Tide or a character with the nickname ""Blood Raven."""
97,1,"The analysis found moderate to strong alignment between the claims and evidence, with no explicit contradictions. The semantic analysis supports the claims, and the causal consistency score is above the threshold. Therefore, the final confidence level is 0.85."
22,1,"The backstory claims that the character secretly helped anti-colonial groups ferry medicine and supplies to civilians, adopted the creed of “quiet chivalry for the weak,” and came into possession of Spanish-American rebel correspondence that sharpened his knowledge of Southern-Hemisphere geography. The evidence from the novel supports these claims, particularly in the context of the character's actions and knowledge. The semantic analysis results show a moderate support score of 0.52, but the causal consistency score is high at 0.70, indicating that the claims are generally consistent with the narrative. The lack of explicit contradictions and the moderate support score suggest that the claims are plausible, but not strongly supported. Therefore, I predict that the backstory is consistent with the evidence from the novel, with a moderate level of confidence."
53,1,"The backstory claims that Thaouka and his master formed a deep bond after a near-death experience where Thaouka chewed herbs to stop the bleeding. Key evidence pieces supporting this claim include Thaouka's willingness to sacrifice himself for his master (Evidence 1), his agitation and attempts to flee towards the north when sensing danger (Evidence 2), and his desperate attempts to reach his master when they are separated during the flood (Evidence 5). The semantic analysis results show a high overall support score of 0.80, indicating strong alignment between the backstory and the novel's evidence. The causal consistency score of 0.70 further supports this alignment, suggesting that the events in the backstory are causally consistent with the events in the novel. Therefore, the final confidence is 0.92, indicating a strong alignment between the backstory and the novel's evidence."
58,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: 
1. The mission priest taught him Quechua, Spanish and French, showed him European maps, the stars and the arithmetic of navigation."
81,0,"The analysis found two claims in the backstory: (1) a whaling crew threatened the village when Glenarvan was fourteen, and (2) a captured Spanish sailor taught him Spanish slang. However, the evidence from the novel does not directly support these claims. The overall support score is 0.70, indicating moderate alignment, and the causal consistency score is 0.70, indicating moderate alignment. Therefore, the confidence is 0.85-0.90, and the judgment is 0, indicating that the claims are not supported by the evidence."
47,0,"The backstory claims that the protagonist's father was killed by colonists for refusing to reveal migration routes, and the protagonist fled alone, carrying his father's silver horse-gear. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. The novel mentions several events and conversations, but none of them involve the protagonist's father being killed by colonists or the protagonist fleeing with his father's silver horse-gear. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.41, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the novel's evidence. Furthermore, the causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the events in the novel are not directly related to the backstory claims. Therefore, based on the semantic analysis and the lack of supporting evidence, I predict that the backstory is inconsistent with the novel's evidence."
7,0,"The backstory claims that the character insisted on traveling light, leading to the deaths of three team members due to malaria, and thereafter kept a bulging backpack wherever he went. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim."
121,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: 
1. Aboard the prison transport he met Edmond Dantès’ father, 
2. heard tales of the merchant Pharaon, 
3. and thus gained the first thread that later let him recognise the young sailor."
129,0,"The backstory claims that the character learnt to carve fish-bone pen-nibs from an old Macao watchmaker, allowing him to pursue scholarship without proper tools. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the character, Faria, is skilled in making various tools and objects, including pens, ink, and paper, but there is no mention of him learning to carve fish-bone pen-nibs from a watchmaker. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.37, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the evidence. Furthermore, the causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the evidence does not provide a clear causal link to the backstory claim. Therefore, based on the analysis, the judgment is that the backstory is inconsistent with the evidence from the novel."
51,0,"The backstory claims that an old shepherd died shielding Thalcave, and with his last breath begged the youth to “stand between civilisation and the wild.” However, the evidence from the novel does not support this claim. In fact, the novel describes a scene where Thalcave is about to leave the group to sacrifice himself to save them from wolves, but Glenarvan stops him and decides to go instead. This contradicts the backstory's claim that the old shepherd died shielding Thalcave. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.63, which indicates a moderate alignment between the backstory and the novel. However, the presence of contradictions and the low causal consistency score (0.70) suggest that the backstory is not consistent with the evidence from the novel. Therefore, I predict a judgment of 0 with a confidence of 0.85."
127,0,"The backstory claims that the character kept his wits by calculating Mediterranean tides during 20 years in one cell and used this skill to predict guards' rounds in the original story. However, the evidence from the novel does not directly support these claims. The overall support score is 0.54, indicating weak alignment. The causal consistency score is 0.80, but this does not compensate for the weak evidence. Therefore, the final judgment is inconsistent with the evidence, and the confidence is 0.70."
133,0,"The backstory claim about university lectures on Enlightenment science convincing him that religion and reason could be fused into one worldview is not directly supported by the provided evidence. The overall support score is low (0.36), and there are no explicit contradictions. However, the narrative is generally coherent, as indicated by the causal consistency score (0.70). Therefore, we predict 0 with a moderate confidence range, acknowledging the lack of direct evidence supporting the claim."
52,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: ""On the Patagonian frontier he trapped a wary black stallion named Thaouka"" and ""spent three months taming it with ancient Tehuelche methods"". Key evidence alignment/contradiction is found in Evidence 1, where Thaouka is described as a horse that has been tamed by Thalcave, and is obedient to his commands. The semantic analysis supports this claim with a high support score of 0.77 and a causal consistency score of 0.70. The evidence shows that Thaouka is a well-trained horse that can be controlled by Thalcave, which aligns with the backstory claim of spending three months taming it. Therefore, the final confidence justification is that the backstory is consistent with the evidence from the novel."
114,0,"The backstory claims about the character's education and cryptographic expertise are not strongly supported by the evidence from the novel. While Faria's abilities and skills suggest a similar background, there is no direct evidence to confirm the claims. The semantic analysis provides a moderate support score, but the causal consistency score is high, which adds some confidence to the judgment. However, the overall confidence remains low due to the weak alignment score."
2,0,"The backstory claims that the character secretly studied Latin in a church school, was made to stand as punishment, and befriended a Spanish-speaking caretaker, picking up basic Spanish while helping the man compose letters. However, the evidence from the novel does not support this claim. In fact, the semantic analysis results show a low support score of 0.74, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the novel's evidence. Furthermore, the novel explicitly states that the character, Glenarvan, speaks Spanish due to his acquaintance with a Spanish-speaking caretaker, but this is not the same as learning Latin. The semantic analysis also reveals a potential contradiction in the backstory, as it implies that the character learned Spanish while helping the caretaker compose letters, but the novel suggests that Glenarvan's Spanish skills were acquired through his acquaintance with the caretaker, not through learning Latin. Therefore, the analysis concludes that the backstory is inconsistent with the evidence from the novel."
33,0,"The main claims found in the backstory are: ""He volunteered for Captain Grant’s crew chiefly to spy on the colonisation schemes backed by Scottish nobles."" This claim is an event that occurred in the past, and its importance is medium."
15,0,"The backstory claims that the character learned to gauge a tribe's degree of civilization by studying the bone ornaments they wore during his Amazon years. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the character, Paganel, is more interested in studying Spanish and geography, as evident from his conversations with Glenarvan and his observations of the landscape. The semantic analysis results also indicate a moderate support score of 0.50, which suggests that the evidence does not strongly align with the backstory claim. Furthermore, the causal consistency score is high at 0.70, but this does not compensate for the lack of evidence supporting the claim. Therefore, the final judgment is that the backstory claim is inconsistent with the evidence from the novel."
82,0,"The backstory claims that the character gnawed fish-bones to stay alive during months of imprisonment and inspired fellow captives by chewing burnt bone ash. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support these claims. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.61, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the novel's evidence. The causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the evidence does not provide a clear causal link to the backstory claims."
37,0,"The main claims found in the backstory are that Tom Ayrton was born near Exeter to a fisherman father, retired naval petty-officer James Ayrton, and that he was reared by his elder brother Benjamin, learning tides and wind signs on fishing trips while secretly studying the Nautical Almanac and dreaming of “conquering the seas”. However, the evidence from the novel contradicts this claim. In Evidence 3, Tom Ayrton is described as a quartermaster who was washed overboard and cast ashore, and he does not mention being born near Exeter or being reared by his brother Benjamin. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.75, indicating a moderate alignment, but the explicit contradiction found in the evidence overrides the support score. Therefore, the final confidence is 0.85."
3,0,"The main claims found in the backstory are: 
1. The character quarrelled with his father after his mother died and left home.
2. He carried the Polynesian nautical charts his mother bequeathed to him."
103,1,"The claims that Noirtier distanced himself from former comrades and grew wary of power's corruption are supported by moderate evidence (support score: 0.73) and moderate causal consistency (0.70). The semantic analysis suggests a moderate alignment, and the causal consistency score is above 0.75. Therefore, the final confidence is 0.85-0.90, and the judgment is 1, indicating that the backstory is consistent with the evidence from the novel."
94,0,"The backstory claims that Villefort allowed his private doctor to test a new sedative on political prisoners to treat his worsening hand tremors, which gave him leverage over enemies even after paralysis set in. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that Villefort's doctor, d'Avrigny, is a conscientious man who is concerned about the welfare of his patients, and there is no indication that he would engage in such unethical behavior. Furthermore, the semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.43, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the evidence. The causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the evidence does not provide a clear causal link to the backstory claim. Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude that the backstory is inconsistent with the evidence from the novel."
85,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: ""Hearing that foreigners sought the missing captain's daughter and would pay richly for her return, he volunteered to lead the pursuit."" This claim is related to the character's motivation and decision to take action."
21,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: 
1. The Royal Navy frigate HMS Austin, bound for Australia and New Zealand under Lieutenant Grant, quietly promoted the sympathetic young sailor to ship’s assistant.
2. The HMS Austin's ship's assistant, Ayrton, was a sympathetic young sailor who was promoted by Lieutenant Grant."
49,0,"The provided backstory claims are not directly supported by the evidence in the novel. While the narrative mentions the Andes and the protagonist's journey through the mountains, it does not explicitly confirm the protagonist's solo living experience in the Andean border wilds for two years. The overall support score is 0.52, indicating weak alignment. The causal consistency score is 0.70, indicating moderate alignment. However, the lack of direct evidence and the weak support score lead to a prediction of 0 with 0.65-0.75 confidence."
140,0,"The claim ""Friendships forged in secret cells and exile sustained him through the long years of imprisonment and seclusion"" is not strongly supported by the evidence. While Faria's resourcefulness and knowledge are evident, there is no direct evidence of friendships being forged in secret cells and exile. The semantic analysis provides a weak support score of 0.54, and the causal consistency score is 0.70. Therefore, the final confidence is 0.65-0.75, indicating a weak alignment between the claim and the evidence."
64,0,"The main claims found in the backstory are: 
1. South-latitude incident: off the Chilean coast he ferried water and provisions to a burning barque and fished a sailor from the sea during a squall."
131,0,"** The backstory claims are partially supported by the evidence from the novel, but the alignment is weak. The protagonist's family is still of noble status, but the family library claim is not directly supported. The memory claim is partially supported, but the overall confidence is low due to the weak alignment."
61,0,"The backstory claims that the main character's little sister Nawee was seized by slave-raiders, and he swore to help anyone in distress. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support this claim. The main character, Glenarvan, is shown to be a brave and noble person who helps others, but there is no mention of a sister being seized by slave-raiders. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.44, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the novel's evidence. The causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the events in the novel are consistent with each other, but not necessarily with the backstory. Therefore, the analysis concludes that the backstory is inconsistent with the evidence from the novel, with a confidence of 0.85."
86,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are: ""At first Glenarvan found him haughty and cold, yet observed that the man valued life and kept his word; though words were few, a fragile trust grew between them during their stand-off."" This claim is related to Glenarvan's perception of the man's personality and behavior."
38,1,"The backstory claims that the character has a quick temper and refuses to accept unjust punishment, leading to repeated discipline and growing disillusion. This is supported by the evidence in the novel, particularly in Evidence 1, where Glenarvan is described as being ""much alarmed by the seriousness of the situation"" and taking charge of the situation, showing a sense of responsibility and leadership. The semantic analysis results show a high overall support score of 0.69, indicating a strong alignment between the backstory claims and the evidence in the novel. Furthermore, the causal consistency score is 1.00, indicating that the claims are causally consistent with the events in the novel. Therefore, the final confidence is 0.92, indicating a strong alignment between the backstory claims and the evidence in the novel."
132,1,"The analysis found moderate alignment with the claims, with a support score of 0.64 and a causal consistency score of 0.70. Although there is no direct evidence for Claim 1, the overall semantic analysis supports the claims of being fluent in several languages (Claim 2). The moderate alignment and high causal consistency justify a confidence level of 0.85-0.90."
77,0,"The main claims found in the backstory are: 
1. As a boy, Glenarvan was rescued by British biologist Wallace.
2. Wallace left behind a bird-of-paradise picture book that, twenty years later, convinced Glenarvan of a connection to the naturalist."
70,0,"The backstory claims that the character earned the chieftainship by surviving seven days and nights alone on the crater's rim, bringing back a sulphur-crusted sacred stone, and married a white princess Julia of the west-coast tribe. However, the provided evidence from the novel does not support these claims."
115,0,"The provided text does not provide direct evidence to support the claims in the backstory. While the text does mention the character's expertise in toxicology, it does not specify how he acquired this expertise. The semantic analysis results show a weak alignment between the claims and the evidence, and a moderate alignment in terms of causal consistency. Therefore, the final judgment is that the backstory is inconsistent with the evidence from the novel."
78,0,"The provided backstory claims that the protagonist's father guarded the island's paramount chief and his mother was a princess from a neighboring island. However, the evidence from the novel does not support these claims. The protagonist's father is not mentioned in the novel, and there is no mention of the mother being a princess from a neighboring island. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.54, indicating a weak alignment between the backstory and the novel. Furthermore, the causal consistency score is 0.70, which suggests that the events in the novel are not directly related to the backstory claims. The absence of any explicit contradictions and the low support score lead to a prediction of inconsistency."
87,0,"The backstory claims that the character's father was guillotined in 1792 for hiding exiled aristocrats, resulting in chronic hand tremors and lifelong revulsion for the old regime. However, the provided evidence from the novel contradicts this claim. In Evidence 1, Villefort mentions that his father was guillotined, but the circumstances are different: Villefort's father was a Jacobin who was punished by God for his past actions. This implies that Villefort's father was not executed for hiding exiled aristocrats. Furthermore, there is no mention of Villefort's father experiencing chronic hand tremors or revulsion for the old regime. The semantic analysis results show a support score of 0.80, indicating moderate alignment, but the presence of contradictions and the lack of supporting evidence for the original claim lead to a judgment of inconsistency."
75,1,"The provided backstory claims that the character has an extraordinary memory for geographical knowledge and can determine the location of shipwrecks by observing tidal changes. This is supported by Evidence 4, where Ayrton mentions that he was washed from the forecastle as the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not two cable-lengths distant. This aligns with the semantic analysis support score of 0.60, indicating moderate alignment. The causal consistency score of 0.70 further supports this claim, as it suggests that the character's geographical knowledge is indeed useful in determining the location of shipwrecks."
44,1,"The main claims found in the backstory are that the character experienced solitude, which brought pride and remorse to the surface, and that the character's diary confessed both self-loathing for the betrayal and relief that no one knew the truth. The key evidence alignment/contradiction is that the character's behavior on the Duncan suggests a complex emotional state, but Ayrton's silence and obstinacy may indicate a character struggling with guilt or shame. The semantic score interpretation is that the evidence is generally consistent with the claims, but there may be some ambiguity or uncertainty. The final confidence justification is that the causal consistency score is above the threshold, and the support score falls within the moderate alignment range."
