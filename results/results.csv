1,1,"The backstory of John growing up in poverty in London and becoming a doctor to help disadvantaged people is consistent with the evidence from the novel, which describes his childhood marked by financial hardship and his determination to improve his life through studying medicine. The novel also cites his background as the motivation behind his career choices, directly supporting the backstory. The high relevance score of 0.59 and the lack of any direct contradictions in the evidence further reinforce the consistency of the backstory with the novel."
2,0,"The backstory states that John was born wealthy and inherited a private hospital, but the evidence from the novel directly contradicts this, describing John as being born in a poor neighborhood and experiencing financial hardship. This contradiction indicates a clear inconsistency between the backstory and the novel. The novel's portrayal of John's motivations and career choices also aligns with his impoverished upbringing, further supporting the judgment of inconsistency."
