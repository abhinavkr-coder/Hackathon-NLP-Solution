1,0,Insufficient narrative support for backstory
2,0,Insufficient narrative support for backstory
=======
95,0,"The backstory claims that Noirtier pre-emptively handed the conspiracy dossier to a British spy, which led to Villefort's son being murdered. However, the novel provides evidence that contradicts this claim. In Chapter 49, it is stated that Villefort's father, Noirtier, was still alive and had been seen by Villefort just a day after Bertuccio's second visit to Benedetto, which suggests that the murder of Villefort's son was not a result of the dossier being handed over to a British spy. This inconsistency marks the backstory as inconsistent with the novel."
136,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions that the protagonist lived quietly on a small island, drafting a vast work on human intelligence, which is not directly contradicted by the novel. However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to support the idea that the protagonist was working on a vast work on human intelligence, which might slightly reduce the confidence level. Nevertheless, the overall consistency of the narrative and the lack of direct contradictions make the judgment 1."
59,1,"The backstory mentions that the protagonist stayed alive in the mountains with rope-climbing and avalanche-reading skills, which is consistent with the novel's depiction of the characters using a rope to descend a perpendicular wall of rock and navigating through treacherous mountain terrain. While the novel does not explicitly mention avalanche-reading skills, the characters' ability to navigate the terrain and avoid danger suggests that they possess some level of expertise in mountain survival. Overall, the backstory is plausible and not directly contradicted by the novel."
60,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as Thalcave's behavior and his knowledge of European geography, which could be seen as contradicting the backstory. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies are minor and do not significantly impact the overall consistency of the narrative."
124,0,"The backstory states that Caderousse noticed a young man stealing a mooring rope but said nothing, implying that Caderousse is a bystander. However, the novel evidence shows Caderousse as an active participant in various scenes, including being attacked, attempting to kill the abbé, and later escaping with Benedetto. This inconsistency in character behavior and involvement suggests that the backstory is not consistent with the novel."
111,1,"The backstory suggests that the protagonist, Andrea, is a cunning and resourceful individual who uses his wit and connections to navigate challenging situations. While the novel does not directly contradict this portrayal, it does not provide explicit evidence to support the backstory's claims about Andrea's past. However, the novel's depiction of Andrea's cleverness and ability to manipulate situations is consistent with the backstory's description of him as a ""wily youth."""
135,0,"The backstory and the novel are inconsistent due to a direct contradiction regarding the duration of Dantès' imprisonment. The backstory states that Dantès spent four years writing treatises in prison from 1796 to 1800, while the novel suggests that he was imprisoned for a longer period, as evidenced by the inspector's visit in Chapter 14, which takes place a year after Louis XVIII's restoration in 1815. This discrepancy indicates a significant inconsistency between the two."
27,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory explains that the protagonist lost hearing in his left ear after a beating for secretly poring over a captain's charts. However, there is no direct evidence in the provided novel excerpts that contradicts this backstory. The novel focuses on the protagonist's journey and adventures, but it does not provide any information that would contradict the backstory about his past experience."
110,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible and follow a logical sequence. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details, but they do not affect the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
42,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible and follow a logical sequence. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details, but they do not affect the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
56,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible and follow a logical sequence. However, the novel does not explicitly mention the spirit of the plains predicting an earthquake, which is a crucial detail in the backstory. Nevertheless, the novel's events are consistent with the spirit of the plains being a supernatural entity that guides Glenarvan and his companions, and the earthquake prediction is a plausible consequence of this entity's actions."
80,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory describes Kai-Koumou as a chief who has been driven back by British troops and is now on his way to rouse the river tribes, which is consistent with the novel's depiction of Kai-Koumou as a fierce and cruel chief who is leading a canoe of European prisoners. The novel also mentions that Kai-Koumou's influence is surpassed by Kara-Tété, which is consistent with the backstory's mention of Kara-Tété as a high-ranking chief."
28,0,"The backstory and the novel are inconsistent because the novel reveals that Ayrton is actually a convict named Ben Joyce, which directly contradicts the backstory that he is the mate of the merchant Emerald Bird. This contradiction suggests that the backstory is not consistent with the events of the novel."
101,0,"The backstory states that the protagonist joined a radical republican cell at 18, but the novel reveals that the protagonist, Edmond Dantès, was a young sailor who was falsely accused and imprisoned. This significant difference in the protagonist's life path and circumstances makes the backstory inconsistent with the novel."
91,0,"The backstory claims that Villefort organized the assassination of royalist deputies while working for Fouché, but the novel presents Villefort as a prosecutor who is concerned with uncovering conspiracies and is even praised by the king for his perspicacity. This inconsistency suggests that the backstory is not consistent with the novel."
24,0,"The backstory is inconsistent with the novel because it directly contradicts the events described in the novel. Specifically, the backstory claims that Ayrton was the one who had been abandoned on the west coast of Australia in 1862, but the novel describes Ayrton as a quartermaster who was already in Australia, guiding the party across the province of Victoria, and had been with Captain Grant's family since the beginning of the journey. This inconsistency suggests that the backstory is not a plausible explanation for the events in the novel."
119,1,"The backstory and the novel are generally consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible and align with the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the fact that the novel mentions Dantès being 19 when arrested, while the backstory does not provide a specific age for Dantès. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies do not significantly impact the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
93,1,"The backstory about Villefort secretly raising the ""Southern Army"" in Marseille for Napoleon is consistent with the novel. Although the novel does not directly confirm the existence of the ""Southern Army,"" it does show Villefort's involvement in a conspiracy related to Napoleon and his efforts to uncover the truth about the letter from the Island of Elba. The novel's portrayal of Villefort's actions and motivations aligns with the backstory, suggesting that he was indeed involved in a plot related to Napoleon's return to power."
72,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible and follow a logical sequence. However, there are some minor inconsistencies and plot twists that might raise questions about the backstory's accuracy, but overall, the novel does not provide enough evidence to contradict the backstory."
16,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the geographer's nationality and occupation, which are not directly addressed in the backstory. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies do not significantly impact the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
30,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory describes the protagonist, Blood Raven, as a pirate who joined the Black Tide crew and became second mate within three years. This is plausible and not contradicted by the novel, which focuses on a different set of characters and events. The novel does not provide any information that directly contradicts the backstory, and the events in the novel do not seem to be influenced by the backstory in a way that would create inconsistencies."
97,1,"The backstory of ""Poison Mastery"" is consistent with the novel as it is plausible and not directly contradicted by the evidence. The novel presents a scenario where the characters are aware of and experimenting with various poisons, including brucine, which is consistent with the idea that the protagonist has gained knowledge of poison mastery through experimentation. However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to contradict the backstory, and the characters' actions and dialogue suggest a plausible scenario where they are trying to understand and counteract the effects of poison."
22,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions that Paganel helped anti-colonial groups and came into possession of Spanish-American rebel correspondence, which is plausible given his expertise in geography and his enthusiasm for the search for Captain Grant. The novel also portrays Paganel as a knowledgeable and enthusiastic geographer who is deeply invested in the search for Captain Grant, which aligns with the backstory. However, the novel does not provide direct evidence that supports the backstory's claim about Paganel's involvement with anti-colonial groups, which reduces the confidence level to 0.85."
53,1,"The backstory describes Thaouka and Thalave forming a deep bond after a near-death experience, where Thaouka saves Thalave's life by chewing herbs to stop the bleeding. The novel's evidence does not directly contradict this backstory, and it is plausible that Thaouka's actions in the novel (e.g. saving Thalave and Glenarvan from the wolves and the flood) could be motivated by a deep bond formed in a previous traumatic event."
58,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. However, the novel does not provide enough information to confirm the details of the backstory, which might affect the confidence level."
81,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible given the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the fact that Glenarvan's ability to speak Spanish is not explicitly mentioned in the novel, but it is not a direct contradiction of the backstory. Overall, the consistency between the backstory and the novel is high, but not perfect."
47,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the events described in the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the circumstances. However, the novel does not provide direct evidence to confirm the events of the backstory, which might affect the confidence level."
7,1,"The backstory states that the protagonist insisted on traveling light, leading to the deaths of three team members due to malaria. This is consistent with the novel, where the party faces a malaria outbreak and several members die. The backstory's emphasis on the protagonist's decision to travel light is also supported by the novel's depiction of the party's struggles with supplies and the consequences of their actions."
121,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions that Dantès met Edmond Dantès' father on a prison transport, which led him to hear tales of the merchant Pharaon, and later recognize the young sailor. This is plausible and not contradicted by the novel, which shows Dantès' interactions with the crew of the Pharaon and his attempts to remain incognito. The novel's events are consistent with the backstory's causal chain, suggesting that the backstory is a coherent and plausible explanation for Dantès' actions and experiences."
129,1,"The backstory about Faria's resourcefulness and ingenuity in prison is generally consistent with the novel. While there are some minor inconsistencies, such as Faria's ability to make paper, ink, and pens, which is not explicitly mentioned in the novel, the overall narrative of Faria's cleverness and determination is supported by the evidence. The novel presents Faria as a skilled and intelligent individual who is able to adapt and overcome the challenges of prison life, which aligns with the backstory."
51,1,"The backstory states that the old shepherd died shielding Thalcave, and with his last breath begged the youth to “stand between civilisation and the wild.” This is consistent with the novel, where Thalcave is portrayed as a brave and selfless individual who is willing to risk his life to protect others. The novel also shows Thalcave's actions and decisions aligning with the old shepherd's request, such as his plan to sacrifice himself to save his friends from the wolves."
127,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory explains how Dantès kept his wits by calculating Mediterranean tides, which later helped him predict guards' rounds. This is plausible and not contradicted by the novel, which shows Dantès using his knowledge of the sea and his ability to navigate to escape from the vessel and later to return to Monte Cristo. The novel also shows Dantès' resourcefulness and ability to think strategically, which is consistent with the backstory's portrayal of him as someone who kept his wits during his imprisonment."
133,1,"The backstory suggests that the protagonist was convinced that religion and reason could be fused into one worldview after university lectures on Enlightenment science. This is consistent with the novel's portrayal of the protagonist, who is depicted as a rational and logical thinker, as seen in Evidence 1 where Andrea uses logic to calm himself down. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the protagonist's actions and thoughts are consistent with someone who has been influenced by Enlightenment ideas."
52,1,"The backstory describes Glenarvan's experience with Thaouka, a black stallion, on the Patagonian frontier, where he spent three months taming it using ancient Tehuelche methods. The novel provides evidence that supports this backstory, showing Glenarvan's ability to communicate with Thaouka and the horse's intelligence and loyalty. While the novel does not provide explicit details about the taming process, the evidence suggests that Glenarvan's relationship with Thaouka is consistent with the backstory, making it plausible and not contradicted by the novel."
114,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel presents Faria as a knowledgeable and resourceful individual who has spent years in prison, which is consistent with the backstory that he was a prisoner and had ample time to read and study. The novel also shows Faria's exceptional memory and ability to learn languages, which is plausible given his backstory. However, the novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel can be seen as a natural consequence of Faria's experiences and abilities."
2,1,"The backstory states that the protagonist, Glenarvan, learned basic Spanish while helping a Spanish-speaking caretaker compose letters. This is consistent with the novel, where Glenarvan is able to understand and communicate in Spanish with the Patagonian, Thalcave. Although Paganel initially makes a mistake in thinking that Thalcave speaks Araucanian, he is eventually able to communicate with him in Spanish, supporting the idea that Glenarvan's knowledge of Spanish is plausible and not contradicted by the novel."
33,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the fact that the novel mentions the Glenarvan family's wealth and their ability to afford a steam yacht, while the backstory does not explicitly mention their wealth. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies do not significantly impact the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
15,1,"The backstory suggests that the narrator, Paganel, gauges a tribe's degree of civilization by studying the bone ornaments they wear. However, the novel does not directly contradict this claim, and it is plausible that Paganel would use such a method to assess the level of civilization in a tribe. While the novel does not explicitly mention Paganel using this method, it does not provide any evidence to contradict the backstory, making it consistent with the novel."
82,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory describes a character who gnawed fish-bones to stay alive during imprisonment, which is a plausible and coherent explanation for how he survived. The novel does not directly contradict this backstory, and the events that unfold are consistent with the character's resourcefulness and determination to survive."
37,0,"The backstory and the novel are inconsistent because Tom Ayrton's backstory claims that he was a quartermaster on the Britannia, but in the novel, he is introduced as a quartermaster who was washed overboard and cast ashore, and later reveals that he was not one of the sailors on the Britannia. This direct contradiction between the backstory and the novel's evidence marks the narrative as inconsistent."
3,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible given the circumstances. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details of the story, but they do not affect the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
103,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory states that Napoleon's rise to power led to Noirtier distancing himself from former comrades and growing wary of power's corruption. The novel provides evidence that supports this claim, showing how Napoleon's return to power led to Villefort's father, Noirtier, becoming increasingly isolated and wary of power's corruption. The novel's portrayal of Noirtier's character and his relationships with others aligns with the backstory's description of his transformation."
94,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory explains that Villefort used a new sedative on political prisoners to gain leverage over his enemies, which is later revealed to be brucine. This is consistent with the novel, where Villefort is shown to be using brucine on M. Noirtier, and later, the doctor d'Avrigny suspects that Madame de Saint-Méran's death may be related to Villefort's use of brucine. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the backstory."
85,1,"The backstory suggests that foreigners are seeking the missing captain's daughter and are willing to pay richly for her return, which motivates the protagonist to lead the pursuit. While the novel does not directly confirm this plot point, it does not contradict it either. The novel focuses on the search for Captain Grant, and the foreigners' interest in the daughter is not a central plot point, making the backstory plausible and consistent with the novel."
21,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel provides a plausible explanation for the events that unfolded, and the characters' actions and decisions are coherent with the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies and contradictions, but they do not significantly impact the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
49,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. The protagonist's experience in the Andean border wilds, tempering an ice-cold nerve by trailing pumas and dodging bandits, is consistent with the novel's depiction of the protagonist's skills and experiences in the wilderness."
140,1,"The backstory mentions that friendships forged in secret cells and exile sustained the protagonist through long years of imprisonment and seclusion. The novel provides evidence that supports this claim, particularly in the conversations between Dantès and Faria, where Faria's resourcefulness and determination to maintain his mental and physical well-being are highlighted. While there are some minor inconsistencies, such as Faria's claim to have written a treatise on two shirts, which seems implausible, the overall narrative is consistent with the backstory."
64,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible and align with the events described in the backstory. However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to confirm the events of the backstory, which might affect the confidence level."
131,0,"The backstory states that the protagonist was born into a declining Italian noble house, but the novel suggests that the Cavalcanti family is wealthy, with Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti mentioning a sum of 48,000 francs and Monte Cristo implying that the family has a significant fortune. This inconsistency in the family's financial situation contradicts the backstory, indicating that the narrative is not consistent."
61,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the backstory. The novel's focus on the Glenarvan family's actions to help Mary Grant and her brother Robert, and their decision to search for Captain Grant, aligns with the backstory's theme of Robert's desire to help anyone in distress, motivated by the loss of his sister Nawee."
86,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible and follow a logical sequence. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details, but they do not affect the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
38,1,"The backstory describes Glenarvan as having a ""quick temper and refusal to accept unjust punishment,"" which is consistent with his actions in the novel, particularly his decision to save people during a storm and his willingness to defy Captain Mangles' orders. Additionally, Glenarvan's leadership and decision-making skills are evident in the novel, which aligns with the backstory's portrayal of him as a capable and determined individual. Overall, the evidence from the novel supports the consistency of the backstory."
132,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of the protagonist's intelligence, language skills, and historical knowledge. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the protagonist's ability to write and create pens in prison, which might be considered implausible. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies do not directly contradict the backstory, and the overall narrative is coherent and plausible."
77,1,"The backstory and the novel are generally consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible given the context of the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the age of Lord Glenarvan (30-32 years old in the backstory, but not explicitly stated in the novel), but these do not significantly impact the overall consistency of the narrative."
70,0,"The backstory describes Kai-Koumou as a chieftain who earned his position by surviving on a crater's rim and marrying a white princess, only to execute her and ban white marriages. However, the novel portrays Kai-Koumou as a leader who is willing to negotiate with Glenarvan and his companions, and even shows a rivalry between Kai-Koumou and Kara-Tété, suggesting that Kai-Koumou's position is not as absolute as the backstory suggests. This inconsistency in the portrayal of Kai-Koumou's character and leadership style makes the backstory inconsistent with the novel."
115,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible and do not challenge the credibility of the backstory. However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to support the backstory, and some details mentioned in the novel (e.g., the character's expertise in toxicology) are not directly related to the backstory. Nevertheless, the overall consistency of the narrative suggests that the backstory is plausible and not contradicted by the novel."
78,0,"The backstory mentions that the protagonist's mother was a princess from a neighboring island, and the father guarded the island's paramount chief. However, the novel does not provide any evidence of the protagonist's family being royalty or having a high social status. In fact, the novel portrays the protagonist's family as being shipwrecked and struggling to survive, which contradicts the idea of a royal family. This inconsistency suggests that the backstory is not consistent with the novel."
87,1,"The backstory about Villefort's father being guillotined in 1792 for hiding exiled aristocrats is consistent with the novel. Although the novel does not directly mention the father's crime, it implies that Villefort's father was involved in the old regime, which is consistent with the backstory. The novel also shows Villefort's revulsion for the old regime, which is a plausible consequence of his father's execution."
75,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible and follow a logical sequence. The only potential inconsistency is the character of Paganel's plan to create a volcano, which seems to contradict his backstory of viewing volcanic eruptions as divine punishment against colonizers. However, this can be seen as a character development and a plot twist, rather than a direct contradiction of the backstory."
44,1,"The backstory mentions that the protagonist's diary expresses both self-loathing for a betrayal and relief that no one knows the truth. However, the novel does not directly contradict this information, and it is plausible that the protagonist could be experiencing such emotions. The novel's focus on the reunion of Captain Grant with his children and the subsequent events does not directly address the backstory, making it consistent with the novel's narrative."
