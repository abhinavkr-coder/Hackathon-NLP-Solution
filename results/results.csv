136,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.46). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to confirm the backstory, which might affect the confidence level."
59,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the skills mentioned in the backstory (rope-climbing and avalanche-reading), and the events in the novel do not suggest that the protagonist lacks these skills. However, the novel does not explicitly mention the protagonist using these skills, which might slightly reduce the confidence in the consistency."
60,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of Thalcave's character and actions. The novel portrays Thalcave as a skilled guide who is calm and serious, which aligns with the backstory's description of him as a leader who saved eight survivors from an avalanche. The novel also shows Thalcave's ability to navigate and understand the geography of the area, which is consistent with the backstory's implication that he is familiar with the region."
124,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.43). Original rationale: The backstory about Faria's past as the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada is consistent with the novel.

111,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.47). Original rationale: The backstory suggests that Noirtier, despite being paralyzed, still pulls strings through old friends and encourages anti-royalist moves. The novel provides evidence that supports this claim, showing Noirtier's continued influence and strategic thinking, even in his paralyzed state. While the novel does not explicitly state that Noirtier is still actively involved in politics, the evidence suggests that he is still a force to be reckoned with, and his actions have a significant impact on the plot."
135,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.43). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible given the circumstances.

110,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.47). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel provides evidence that M. Noirtier de Villefort is a Bonapartist and a vice-president of a club in the Rue Saint-Jacques, which aligns with the backstory's mention of his involvement in the Bonapartist movement. The novel also shows M. Noirtier's intelligence and ability to communicate through his eyes, which is consistent with the backstory's portrayal of him as a powerful and influential figure."
42,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in portraying Ayrton as a quartermaster with an ""unstable record"" and a mysterious past. Although the novel reveals more about Ayrton's character, such as his reluctance to answer questions and his possible involvement in Captain Grant's disappearance, these details do not contradict the backstory. The novel's portrayal of Ayrton's character is plausible and aligns with the initial description in the backstory."
56,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.44). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of the character's actions and behavior, particularly in relation to Thalcave's prediction of the earthquake and his subsequent actions. The novel provides evidence that supports Thalcave's character traits, such as his ability to predict natural disasters and his concern for his companions. However, the novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible and consistent with the character's personality."
80,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.45). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the events described in the backstory, such as Kai-Koumou's reputation as a fierce warrior and his interest in ransoming Tohonga. However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to confirm the events described in the backstory, such as Kai-Koumou's father being killed by pirate raiders and the protagonist learning tactics from him. Nevertheless, the overall narrative of the novel is plausible and does not contradict the backstory, making it consistent."
28,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible and follow a logical sequence. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details, but they do not affect the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
101,0,"The backstory states that the protagonist joined a radical republican cell at 18, but the novel evidence suggests that M. Noirtier, the father of Villefort, was a radical republican and a Jacobin, and Villefort himself seems to be a Bonapartist. This inconsistency in political affiliations and the protagonist's involvement in radical movements makes the backstory inconsistent with the novel."
91,0,"The backstory claims that Villefort organized the assassination of royalist deputies while posing as a Ministry of Justice official, and an arsenic phial lies in a hidden drawer of his study desk. However, the novel reveals that Villefort is actually the son of M. Noirtier, a former Jacobin and senator, and that Villefort's father is a paralytic who communicates through eye movements. This suggests that Villefort's backstory is inconsistent with the novel, as there is no indication that Villefort was involved in the assassination of royalist deputies or that he has an arsenic phial in his study desk."
24,0,"The backstory and the novel are inconsistent because the novel explicitly states that Paganel was on a voyage to India, but the backstory implies that he was on a voyage to South America. This contradiction suggests that the backstory is not consistent with the novel."

The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory.

93,0,Hallucination risk=1.00; critical term 'barrel' appears in backstory but is absent from retrieved evidence.
72,0,"The backstory states that Glenarvan sent twelve English-speaking youths as spies into Auckland, but the novel does not mention any spies or their involvement in the events. This significant discrepancy suggests that the backstory is inconsistent with the novel."
16,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.42). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel portrays Paganel as a geographer with eccentricities and a tendency to make blunders, which is consistent with the backstory's description of him as a ""distinguished scholar"" and ""one of the best geographers of France."" The novel also shows Paganel's national pride and love for science, which aligns with the backstory's mention of his French heritage and his father's work with the East India Company."
30,0,"The backstory states that the character ""Blood Raven"" earned his nickname by personally cutting the throat of the colonial officer who framed his father, while the novel presents a different scenario where Ayrton (Blood Raven) is suspected of being a traitor and is accused of poisoning the animals, but there is no evidence that he killed the colonial officer. This inconsistency in the character's backstory and actions in the novel suggests that the two are not consistent."
97,1,"The backstory suggests that Villefort's knowledge of poison mastery came from experimenting on prisoners, which allowed him to recognize Barrois' symptoms instantly. This is consistent with the novel, where Villefort's expertise in poison is demonstrated through his conversation with d'Avrigny and the experiment with the syrup of violets. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and Villefort's knowledge of poison is a crucial plot point, making the backstory plausible and consistent with the novel."
22,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions that Paganel's knowledge of Southern-Hemisphere geography was sharpened by Spanish-American rebel correspondence, which is plausible and not contradicted by the novel. The novel does not provide any direct evidence that contradicts the backstory, and the events in the novel can be seen as a natural consequence of Paganel's knowledge and skills."
53,1,"The backstory describes Thaouka and Glenarvan forming a deep bond after a near-death experience, where Thaouka helps Glenarvan survive a fall. The novel consistently portrays Thaouka as a loyal and intelligent horse, often sensing danger and helping Glenarvan and the group. While the novel does not explicitly mention the backstory event, the horse's behavior and Glenarvan's affection for him suggest a strong bond, making the backstory plausible and consistent with the novel."
58,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.48). Original rationale: The backstory mentions that the mission priest taught the protagonist various languages, including Quechua, Spanish, and French, as well as European maps, the stars, and arithmetic of navigation. This information is consistent with the novel, where the protagonist, Glenarvan, is able to communicate with the Patagonian, Thalcave, and understand his language, despite not speaking it fluently. The novel also shows Glenarvan's knowledge of geography and navigation, which aligns with the backstory's description of his education."
81,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions that the protagonist, Kai-Koumou, was a skilled warrior who defended his village against a whaling crew at the age of 14, and that he learned Spanish slang from a captured Spanish sailor. The novel does not directly contradict this information, and the events that unfold are plausible given Kai-Koumou's character as described in the backstory. However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to confirm the details of the backstory, which might affect the confidence level."

7,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions that Paganel's team died due to malaria, and he kept a bulging backpack as a result. This is plausible and not directly contradicted by the novel, which shows Paganel's enthusiasm for collecting and his national pride. However, the novel does not explicitly mention the backpack, which might slightly reduce the confidence level."
121,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel provides evidence that supports the idea that Faria's past experiences and knowledge were acquired through his association with Cardinal Spada, which is in line with the backstory. The novel also shows how Faria's past experiences and knowledge influenced his interactions with Dantès, further supporting the consistency of the backstory."
129,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.42). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel provides evidence that Dantès learned to carve fish-bone pen-nibs from an old Macao watchmaker, which is plausible and not contradicted by the novel. The novel also shows Dantès' resourcefulness and ability to create tools, which aligns with the backstory. However, the confidence level is not 1.0 because the novel does not explicitly mention the watchmaker, and the evidence provided is mostly about Dantès' resourcefulness and ability to create tools, which could be inferred from the backstory but is not a direct contradiction."
51,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency.

133,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.33). Original rationale: The backstory suggests that Faria was a secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada, who was not rich but had a reputation for wealth. This is consistent with the novel, where Faria talks about Cardinal Spada annotating ancient volumes and searching for family manuscripts, indicating a life of study and intellectual pursuits rather than wealth. The novel also portrays Faria as a rational and logical person, which aligns with the backstory's depiction of him as a wise and knowledgeable individual."
52,1,"The backstory describes Thaouka as a black stallion that Glenarvan tamed using ancient Tehuelche methods, which is consistent with the novel's depiction of Thaouka as a strong and intelligent horse that Glenarvan and Thalcave have a close bond with. The novel does not contradict the backstory, and the events described in the novel are plausible given the backstory. However, the confidence level is not 1.0 because the novel does not explicitly mention the taming process, and some details about Thaouka's behavior and abilities are not directly related to the backstory."
114,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.41). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency.

33,0,Hallucination risk=1.00; critical term 'spy' appears in backstory but is absent from retrieved evidence.
15,1,"The backstory suggests that Paganel gauges a tribe's degree of civilization by studying the bone ornaments they wear. This is consistent with the novel, where Paganel is described as a geographer who is knowledgeable about various cultures and civilizations, and he is able to provide detailed information about the tribes he encounters. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the evidence suggests that Paganel's expertise in anthropology and geography is consistent with the backstory."
82,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.49). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the novel mentioning that the captives are being taken to exchange them for a high-priest, which is not mentioned in the backstory. Nevertheless, the overall consistency of the narrative is maintained, and the backstory provides a plausible explanation for the events in the novel."
37,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory.

However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details of Paganel's past, such as his marriage and his experiences with the Maoris, but these do not significantly impact the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
103,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in portraying Noirtier as a man who distanced himself from former comrades and grew wary of power's corruption. This is evident in the novel, where Noirtier is shown to be a senator who protected Villefort, a Bonapartist, and was all-powerful at court. The novel also highlights Noirtier's past as a Jacobin and his involvement in conspiracies, which aligns with the backstory's description of him as a man who strove for possibilities and applied the theories of The Mountain to achieve his goals."
94,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory states that Noirtier de Villefort used a new sedative on political prisoners to treat his hand tremors, which gave him leverage over his enemies. This is plausible and not directly contradicted by the novel. The novel does not provide explicit evidence that contradicts this backstory, and it is consistent with the character's actions and motivations in the novel."
85,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.47). Original rationale: The backstory suggests that the protagonist volunteered to lead the pursuit of the missing captain's daughter due to the promise of a rich reward from foreigners. However, the novel does not directly contradict this information, and the events that unfold are plausible given the context. The novel focuses more on the characters' interactions and the challenges they face in their captivity, rather than explicitly addressing the reward or the foreigners' involvement."

However, the novel does not provide explicit evidence to confirm the backstory, which might affect the confidence level."
49,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.47). Original rationale: The backstory describes Thalcave as a skilled guide who has lived in the Andean border wilds for two years, tempering his nerve by trailing pumas and dodging bandits. This is consistent with the novel, where Thalcave is portrayed as a knowledgeable and resourceful guide who helps the group navigate the Patagonian wilderness. The novel also shows Thalcave's skills in tracking and hunting, which aligns with the backstory's description of his experiences in the wilds."
140,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.40). Original rationale: The backstory suggests that the friendships forged in secret cells and exile sustained Dantès through imprisonment and seclusion. The novel provides evidence that supports this claim, showing Dantès' close relationship with Abbé Faria, who teaches him various subjects and provides moral support. Although the novel also portrays Faria's physical decline and eventual departure, the overall narrative is consistent with the idea that their friendship sustained Dantès during his imprisonment."
64,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.49). Original rationale: The backstory mentions a south-latitude incident where the protagonist ferries water and provisions to a burning barque and rescues a sailor from the sea. This event is not directly mentioned in the provided evidence from the novel, but the novel does describe a scene where the characters are trying to escape a flood and find a tree to take refuge in. Although the specific incident is not mentioned, the novel's description of the characters' actions and the environment is consistent with the idea of a dramatic and life-threatening situation, which is implied by the backstory. Therefore, I consider the backstory to be consistent with the novel."
131,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.47). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details of Faria's life and abilities, but these do not significantly impact the overall consistency of the narrative."
61,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.47). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the backstory. The novel shows Glenarvan's character as someone who is determined to help others in distress, which aligns with the backstory of him swearing to help anyone in distress after his sister was taken."
86,1,"The backstory describes Glenarvan as initially finding Kai-Koumou haughty and cold, yet observing that the man valued life and kept his word. This is consistent with the novel, where Glenarvan and Kai-Koumou engage in a tense standoff, but Glenarvan also notes Kai-Koumou's respect for life and his willingness to ransom Tohonga. The novel's portrayal of Kai-Koumou's complex personality aligns with the backstory's description, indicating a consistent narrative."
38,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.48). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions Glenarvan's quick temper and refusal to accept unjust punishment, which led to repeated discipline and growing disillusion. This is reflected in the novel when Glenarvan insists on saving people during a storm on a convoy run, despite being reprimanded for disrupting military order. This behavior aligns with the backstory's description of Glenarvan's temperament, indicating a consistent character trait."
132,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.39). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel portrays Faria as a learned and rational individual who has been wrongly accused of madness, which aligns with the backstory's description of him as a star student and a sage.

77,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.49). Original rationale: The backstory mentions that Glenarvan was rescued by British biologist Wallace, who left behind a bird-of-paradise picture book that convinced Glenarvan of a connection to the naturalist. However, the novel does not directly contradict this information, and it is plausible that Glenarvan could have been exposed to Wallace's work through the picture book. The novel's focus on Glenarvan's captivity and interactions with the Maori tribe does not directly address the backstory, making it consistent with the novel's narrative."
70,0,"The backstory describes Kai-Koumou as a chief who executed his white wife, Julia, for passing information to British missionaries and subsequently banned any white marriage. However, in the novel, Kai-Koumou is shown to be willing to ransom the high-priest Tohonga, who is a prisoner of the Europeans, and does not display any animosity towards Glenarvan's wife, Lady Helena, who is also a European. This inconsistency in Kai-Koumou's behavior and policies suggests that the backstory is not consistent with the novel."
115,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.43). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel can be seen as a plausible consequence of the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as the abbé's claim that he has written a comprehensive work on the monarchy of Italy, which seems unlikely given his imprisonment and lack of resources. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies do not significantly impact the overall causal consistency of the narrative."
78,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The backstory mentions that the narrator's father ordered the execution of the murderer's entire clan to stop further unrest, which is a plausible reason for the narrator's traumatic experience. The novel does not directly contradict this backstory, and the events that unfold are consistent with the narrator's character development and the cultural context of the Maori tribe."
87,1,"The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel can be seen as a plausible consequence of the backstory. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in the details of the backstory, such as the exact circumstances of Noirtier's paralysis and the extent of Villefort's knowledge about his father's past. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies do not affect the overall causal consistency of the backstory with the novel."
75,0,"Overridden to INCONSISTENT due to low semantic support (avg_similarity=0.49). Original rationale: The backstory and the novel are consistent in terms of causal consistency. The novel does not directly contradict the backstory, and the events in the novel are plausible given the information provided in the backstory. The only potential inconsistency is the chief's view of volcanic eruptions as divine punishment against colonizers, which is not directly addressed in the novel. However, this is not a strong enough contradiction to mark the judgment as 0."
